# LiU-Ibtroduction to Python

This course covers the following content:

-- Python basics: programming environment and documentation, program flow, variables, comments, numerical operators, loops, conditional statements.

-- Data structures: simple data types, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets, iterators and generators.

-- Functions and functional programming, anonymous lambda functions, comprehensions.

-- Classes and object oriented programming, objects and message passing.

-- The standard library, and touching upon essential third-party packages for graphics, scientific computing and data manipulation.

-- Debugging.

-- Creating Scripts.

* Lab 1: Python Basics: data structures such as strings, dictionaries, and lists, write loops and comprehensions to iterate over sequential data such as lists of strings.

* Lab 2: Python functions, procedural abstraction, some debugging or testing, and functional patterns. The focus is on using the basic language feature of functions (testing exceptions and assertions).

* Lab 3: More in-depth Python functions. Focus on recursion, Higher Order Functions (map, reduce, filter), declarative patterns, function states and parametrization. Tested with various sorting algorithms.

* Lab 4: Python command-line script which generates text based on another text by using successors and their frequency.

* Lab 5: Python class and object concepts.
